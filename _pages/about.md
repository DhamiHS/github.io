Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral researcher at Purdue University in West Lafayette, USA. Previously, I spent a brief stint as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Materials Engineering at IISc, Bengaluru, following the completion of my PhD in Mechanical Engineering. Additionally, I had the opportunity to work as a visiting project staff member at the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), ISRO. 
My research interests lie at the convergence of materials science and mechanical engineering. This fascination stems from the multidisciplinary training I've received throughout my academic journey. As a graduate in mechanical engineering, I became entranced by the principles governing machines, manufacturing processes, and materials. This curiosity propelled me to further my studies and delve deeper into comprehending the underlying physics.
I firmly believe that addressing many of the questions I seek to explore necessitates an interdisciplinary approach. Throughout my research endeavors, I've drawn motivation from both technical challenges and the fundamental aspects of the field. I expect that these dual sources of inspiration will continue to propel my work forward. Please visit the [Research] to see the detailed overview of my research highlights, encompassing both ongoing projects and those I aspire to pursue.
